/* `Player` object: one human, one "AI"/computer
    - Computer player must be able to :
    - Make random plays (Maybe something with math.random? To generate the guessed coordinates)
    - Know what moves are legal (Maybe an if/then statement that validates to see if the move is legal? Like no repeat coordinates, guessing more than once per turn, attacking a sunken ship? etc..)
    - Enhancement: make it multiplayer
